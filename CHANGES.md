5.0.0 2019-01-08
================
- Add connection pooling

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES INTRODUCED IN 5.0.0:

- Removed support for Python 2.6

- Fix url encoding for all endpoints

  Previously, encoding user ids in URLs was inconsistent between endpoints, encoded for some
  endpoints, unencoded for others. Additionally, when encoded in the URL path, forward slashes
  weren't encoded. Callers with workarounds for this bug must remove these workarounds when
  upgrading to 5.0.0.

- Improved error handling

  Previously, illegal arguments passed to methods like `Client.track()` and failed calls resulting
  from server-side errors both raised `ApiExceptions`. Illegal arguments validated in the client
  now raise either `TypeErrors` or `ValueErrors`. Server-side errors still raise `ApiExceptions`,
  and `ApiException` has been augmented with metadata for handling the error.

4.3.0.0 2018-07-31
==================
-   Add support for rescore_user and get_user_score APIs

4.0.1 2018-04-06
==================

4.0.0.0 2018-03-30
==================

- Adds support for Sift Science API Version 205, including new [`$create_content`](https://siftscience.com/developers/docs/curl/events-api/reserved-events/create-content) and [`$update_content`](https://siftscience.com/developers/docs/curl/events-api/reserved-events/update-content) formats
- V205 APIs are now called -- **this is an incompatible change**
   - Use `version = '204'` when constructing the Client to call the previous API version
- Adds support for content decisions to [Decisions API](https://siftscience.com/developers/docs/curl/decisions-api)


INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES INTRODUCED IN API V205:
- `$create_content` and `$update_content` have significantly changed, and the old format will be rejected
- `$send_message` and `$submit_review` events are no longer valid
- V205 improves server-side event data validation. In V204 and earlier, server-side validation accepted some events that did not conform to the published APIs in our [developer documentation](https://siftscience.com/developers/docs/curl/events-api). V205 does not modify existing event APIs other than those mentioned above, but may reject invalid event data that were previously accepted. **Please test your integration on V205 in sandbox before using in production.**
